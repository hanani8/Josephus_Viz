## Overview

The Josephus Problem, also known as the Josephus permutation, is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game. In this problem, "n" soldiers stand in a circle, and they are eliminated in a specific sequence. The problem's objective is to determine the position of the last soldier standing.

This tool allows you to visualize the Josephus problem by providing the following inputs:
- The total number of soldiers ("n").
- The number of people to skip in each step ("k").
- The speed of the visualization.

The tool generates a graphical representation of the elimination process, showing which soldiers are eliminated in each step and highlighting the final survivor.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** The tool provides an interactive SVG-based visualization of the Josephus problem, allowing you to see the elimination process in action.

- **Customizable Parameters:** You can input the total number of soldiers and the number of people to skip, making it flexible for different scenarios.

- **Speed Control:** Adjust the speed of the visualization to see the process at your preferred pace.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Enter the following parameters:
   - Total number of soldiers ("n").
   - Number of people to skip in each step ("k").
   - Speed of the visualization (optional).

3. Click the "Generate!" button to visualize the Josephus problem.

4. Observe the graphical representation of the elimination process. Soldiers are represented as circles, and eliminated soldiers are filled in black. The last survivor is highlighted in red.

5. You can change the input parameters and click "Generate!" again to see the visualization with different settings.
